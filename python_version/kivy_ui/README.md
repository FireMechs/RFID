## Our RFID UI with Kivy

### Getting started 

Make sure to have kivy installed in your DE

```bash
pip3 install kivy
```

### Running the application

```bash
python3 Display.py --size=320x240
```

### INFO

Currently it is just a demo interface. The main aim of this demo is to show how we will be fetching data and updating the display screen keeping in mind that all of kivy's events will now disfunctional since our user interface is no-touch interface. I did used a clockSchedule. Check it out.
